bitstarter
==========
<h3>Stanford's Startup Engineering Project:</h3> https://class.coursera.org/startup-001/class/index

<h3>About:</h3> Bitcoin driven crowdfunder designed to teach backend/frontend Javascript, git best practices, and deploying with EC2 and Heroku.  

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3> Bootstrap 2, Node JS, Emacs, Amazon EC2, Heroku, Postgres

<h3>Test Site</h3>I had three git branches in the original Bitstarter and one of them morphed into this so I broke it off into it's own repo/project 
Heroku test site is up at: 
http://rocky-sierra-4165.herokuapp.com/ (Give the dyno a second to wake up)
